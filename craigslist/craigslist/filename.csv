   ",6000,1991 Mercedes-Benz all original parts,http://sfbay.craigslist.org//sfc/cto/5812879274.html,"
Hi there, 
Im selling my all original 1991 Mercedes-Benz because I'm a college student with no job, and I can't afford to pay insurance each month and it makes more sense for me to just catch bart. :( I am the third owner and I invested a lot into this car. Brand new tires, brand new seat covers (not that those matter because the leather is pretty nice anyways). Just got the oil changed, fixed the vacuum hose, all that good stuff because I had been planning to drive it across country. It runs like a top. No problems. It's been well maintained. And although 238,695 miles sounds like a lot, ask ANY mechanic and they will tell you these Mercedes will run forever. I get compliments on my car everywhere I go. In traffic, parking it, etc. The registration is good till Jan 2017. The title is clean. It comes with the spare tire, manual, all that. Actually, I even know the previous owner personally, and he has all the original tires if you want those as well (although it is on rims). If you want a bling ride this is the ride for you. It's luxury everything. You can fit 5 people comfortably. It's not like these new cars where everyone has to be all tight together. It has the sun roof, huge truck. If you are interested and serious buyers only please, feel free to email me or call me

 and we can arrange a time for you to come by and see the car. Test drive with cash in hand and C license. Cheers! Cordelia    ", (bernal heights),2016-10-04T11:59:32-0700

Registration is ready to be renewed by November.

My baby will need some work. It drives but will need a crank pully replacement and transmission is acting up and may need some work on it.

My mechanic shop can provide more details about the crank pully issue. I wish I know more about cars but I don't. Time to give up my baby to someone that can take good care of it for me and knows more about cars to give it more life.

A/C, heater, and radio works.
Power window and power locks work with one exception (power door lock for driver door works intermittently).

I have spent over $800 in the past few weeks. It comes with the following NEW maintenance:

-Brand New Battery, replaced 2 months ago.
-Replaced New radiator -- 2 weeks ago
-Replaced New break pads (using the best, ceramic) a week ago.
-Oil changed a week ago.
-Had passenger seat detailed a month ago
-New window wiper blades

I'm looking to sell my 2012 Nissan Altima. I'm the second owner - I bought it CPO in 2013, and have worked from home since so it has low miles. Its in great condition, gets good milage, and has some nice features like keyless start and entry.

It's a very good car, I'm only selling because I just moved from Los Angeles and won't need a car here.

- push button start
- keyless entry
- auto transmission
- 23 city / 32 highway mpg
- the only issue is a broken vanity mirror in one of the sun visors (pictured).

   ",11000,2011 NISSAN JUKE S CLEAN TITLE,http://sfbay.craigslist.org//sfc/cto/5800425988.html,"
Here is a 2011 Nissan Juke S. This model is automatic and front wheel drive. It has just a little over 80,000 miles and has a clean title. My girlfriend purchased this car May of last year at a dealership. She works from home so this car has rarely been used. The car has been excellently maintained as I work with Nissan. The car has always been garaged. The ""Cayenne Red"" paint and body plastics are in excellent condition. The tires have about 80% life left on them. The car runs and drives awesome. The interior is in great shape as well. The car has front and rear power windows and front power locks. A lot of recent maintenance has been done recently as follows:

-High quality window tint with a lifetime warranty
-New front and rear windshield wipers
-New cabin filter with ozium treatment
-New floor mat carpet clips
-Drop in K&N air filter installed (added gas mileage and hp, I will throw in the OEM air filter also)

The only cons of the car are as follows:
-Passenger door lock actuator needs to be replaced (100$ fix).
-Front Auxiliary port on CD player does not work (also has one in the glove box).
-Small 1 inch tear in cloth on driver seat (20$ fix)

This car has been excellent to use getting great gas mileage while still being sporty and having plenty of power with a good amount of space! We are moving to San Fransisco other wise we would love to keep it. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to come check out the car! The car comes with the OEM instruction manual and I will throw in a new OEM Nissan Cayenne Red touch up paint pen just in case.

FS my wife's e320 with 98K miles. We bought this car two years ago at 75K on the clock, did some regular maintenance on the car, never had any problems with it. Oil changed religiously at local oil change station. Recently had steering pump and also power steering high pressure hose changed, it was leaking a little bit. Also about a year ago I changed spark plugs and water pump. This car sits on CLS AMG wheels with 285/30 rear and 265/35 at the front tires. Tires are in really good condition, had rears changed not long ago. These wheels make car handle really well, but also a little bit rougher than regular rims/tires. Interior is about 8/10 as well as the exterior. 
So the being said here are some 
BAD"":
- cracked windshield at passenger side

GOOD:
- Nice looking AMG wheels that add looks and definitely handling
- Clean title with real mileage
- did maintenance so you won't have to worry about it

I am the original owner.  The truck runs well and has been well maintained.  However I make client calls on a daily basis so I have moved to a younger vehicle.

This truck is a manual shift, 4x4.  It is also equipped Super-Charger.  The Super Charger will give you another 30 horsepower when used.  It also has a tow package.  The title is clean and in hand.  Smog is current.

Value- Kelley Blue Book criteria rate this vehicle as ""Good"" with a fair private party to private party value at $4042

If you would like to check for yourself here are the inputs:

2001 Nissan Frontier King Cab

Mileage 170500

Supercharged

Body Condition-  As expected for a vehicle this age.  Minor scratches and blemishes but no work needed.

Engine- No leaks.  If you are buying an older truck you are probably concerned about which major components may need to be replaced.  This truck is attractive as most of what you could anticipate has been taken care of already.  I have the service records for you but below is a summary of what has been done at some point during the past 35000 miles:

Brakes, Heater Core, Timing Belt, Water Pump, Tune Up, Radiator Hoses/Thermostat, Radiator  Assembly, Head Gasket	, Distributor, AC Compressor, Clutch & Master Cylinder

Sadly letting go my baby..
Low baller will be ignored... Serious people only
It's been my project for the last 5 years, got really busy last year and a half and just don't have time for it anymore. 
Car is super tight and original. Was professionally restored at a reputable shop here in SF. everything was either rebuilt or replaced with a new part. A few things in the interior will need to be put on to complete the car (see below). Selling it for way less than what I paid for parts and labor alone. A great deal for someone who enjoys this type of projects. I HAVE ALL THE PARTS.. EVERYTHING.. just don't have the time to finish it.

- Clean title with no accidents
- CA car with No rust
- Numbers matching all around
- Great fiberglass and perfect lines
- Correct white exterior painted in the end of 2014, paint alone cost me $4750 (never left the garage since, but not 100% perfect)
- Correct brand new black interior
- Original small block engine, carb and transmission rebuilt
- Brand new brake system (Pads+Rotors+Calipers)
- Brand new power steering system and professionally restored steering column
- Brand new gas tank and gas lines 
- Brand new suspension all around 
- Brand new battery
- Brand new starter
- Brand new upgraded alternator
- Brand new hoses
- New engine belts
- New wiper motor
- Brand new cooling system
- New bushings and ball-joints all around
- Rare original turbine aluminum wheels powder coated black with newer tires
- Alignment done
- Brand new speaker system with hidden amp
- Brand new  center console 
- Brand new door panels, pillars, etc.
- Brand new  AC ducts
- Brand new  seat belts
- Brand new carpet set installed with heat-insulation
- Brand new rubber original mats
- Restored original leather seats with new foam and leather + heated seats option
- Brand new door sills
- Brand new  door panels
- Brand new  premium seals all around
- Brand new  front and rear lights
- New flip-lights air pressure system
- New heater system
- Brand new emblems and logos all around
- Fitted Stingray car cover

I'm sure I've missed something, but no expenses were spared in this restoration since I was planning to keep it for decades to come. More than $25k in receipts + the price of the original car + 1000s of hours of my time, all going to a lucky new owner. My loss is your gain!

What still needs to be finished:

- Installing the new door panels
- Installing the new seats
- Installing the center console (everything works)
- Installing the map pocket (lower dash)
- Installing some of the weather stripping (have it all)
- Some fine tuning here and there

Might consider a trade for a newer vehicle. Don't have time for another classic

Thank you

This. Is. It.

Owning a Lexus is not for everyone. It's something we're born with. It's not something we choose to be. Our DNA is a shift pattern. Our blood comes with an octane rating. Our heartbeat is measured in RPM's.
The sweet smell of burning rubber and the beautiful sound of the engine screaming is pure bliss to us. Some pursue speed. Others are all about the looks.
Four wheels, we all share the same passion. They will never be ""just a car"" to us. They're part of the family. They're our best friend. They are our therapist. It is something ""normal"" people will never understand.
Maybe it's an illness. Maybe we're all sick. Well...if that's the case...I hope they never find a cure.

At only $17,500 is a 2011 All Wheel Drive IS250 with 30k original miles. The vehicle was purchased as a certified pre-owned Lexus from a dealer completing their inspection. I have the title in hand, in my name of course with the current smog. 

This vehicle comes completely loaded and is top of the line for it's model. I have pre-paid 2 months of Sirius Satellite for the next owner. Leather is brand new looking with no rips or scratches in the leather. Cooled and heated seats. Engine and transmission run strong and without issue. Car drives straight as an arrow. Has a backup camera and push start. Amazing MPG at 26 city/33 Hwy.
Vehicle is equipped with a moon-roof.

The KBB is $22,548 - I priced it competitively considering it does have a salvage title. The only parts replaced were both fenders, hood as well as the bumper cover. Everything was repairable, but who likes bondo? New is better.

Hello you're viewing the one and only BMW E39 M5 truly the Ultimate Driving Machine.  This is a very clean low mileage 2000 e39 M5 in great shape only 98,000 Miles on the car. New rear tires @ 88,500 miles, all maintenance (brakes, oils, etc wore always done by me I am a certified BMW mechanic I always use OEM parts and recommend fluids.   Exterior is in excellent shape, there are a few rock chips on the front bumper and one chip on the hood. Interior is also in great shape, the leather seats, dashboard, center counsel and overall interior condition is perfect from 1-10 I would rate it 8. There are alot of small things that make this car truly unique, for example I installed the EONON sterio deck with an android OS system it is loaded with apps and features that any new car sterio would envy it also has a Bluetooth OBD II scanner that works with the head unit to displays real-time engine parameters and scans DTC's. The head unit is also controlled by the factory steering wheel buttons, also there is a rear view camera installed it has it all you have to see it to believe it it is truly amazing. There are OEM Hella angel eyes HID headlights installed and LED rear tail lights these two upgrades make the car look like a 2001+ E39 model. The car has 2 DINAN cold air intakes installed that adds about 20hp after this upgrade alone this car now has 420+ HP!. This car received a brand new BMW OEM clutch kit which includes clutch disk, pressure plate, throw out bearing and a reman flywheel in December 10 2015.  Everything works perfectly on the car it is truly one-of-a-kind, it breaks my heart to put this car up for sale but I have to get a bigger car for my family because I have a Baby on the way and need something like a Minivan or a SUV.

Factory tuned GTI with a 6 speed gear box, lowered & stiffened suspension, oversized brakes, The tuned engine & 6 speed gear box make you fly, the factory tuned suspension glues you to the road in a major way & the extra oversized brakes stop you on a dime. Exterior body mods & a huge array of custom cabin details give the whole thing a very special feel. A joy to drive, this car has been so much fun for us, but alas it is time to move on & get something a bit bigger...

Well maintained, clean, hard to find 2003 VW GTI Anniversary Edition in Black with extremely low miles. 72,000
Production number 2264 of only 4000 made.
Similar to a 335.
Tinted windows and blacked out wheels and VW logo.
Recent 18"" high performance tires
Recent brakes- pads and rotor 
Recent clutch
New CV joint.
New Stereo with CD, AUX, Iphone input- 8 speaker, sounds amazing!
72000 miles mostly freeway driving

""W's latest pocket-rocket pays homage to the original with numerous styling cues, including a polished-metal Rabbit logo with a ""GTI"" red badge on rear hatch. Additional performance accents include black-surround headlights; a larger-diameter, single polished exhaust; darkened taillamps; side mirrors housed in black; and body-color bumper, chin spoiler, side valances, lowered rear bumper, and fixed rear spoiler above the hatch. A lowered sport suspension, 18-inch Z-rated summer performance tires, and larger, vented four-wheel disc brakes help the new GTI tackle the curves. Power comes from VW's 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine --good for 180 horsepower and 173 pound-feet of torque--which is mated to a six-speed manual transmission. The 20th Anniversary GTI's cockpit is a driver's paradise, with black-and-gray sport-cloth Recaro front seats wearing red ""GTI"" embroidery, black headliner, striped safety belts, the signature ""golf ball"" shift knob with red ""GTI"" logo, and a brushed-aluminum plaque that indicates the exact production number for the model, anywhere from 1 to 4000""      Car & Driver

This is a 3 Series back in the good ole days when the 3's used solid, naturally aspirated, V6 engines.  The new ones mostly use turbo 4's.  They are great on gas, but they have the 1 second lag time when you punch the pedal during the times when you have to merge on a fast moving & crowded highway or if you have to make a left turn out of a parking lot on a busy street.  The V6's are intuitive where once you punch it...you go!!!  

This is a 1 owner. Gray on Black leather BMW 325i sedan.  There are some nicks and scratches, but the good thing is that most of them are near the underside caused by scraping on a low curb.  

Sunroof, power everything, automatic, and CD player make this Bimmer a well rounded Ultimate Driving Machine!!!

   ",2200,1985 Toyota Celica GT-S Convertible - Low mileage,http://sfbay.craigslist.org//sfc/cto/5780880540.html,"
1985 Toyota Celica GTS Convertible.  Running and fun driving project car.  Rare, one of 4498 made.  Last of the rear wheel drive Celicas.  Has Supra/GTS has full Independent Rear Suspension and rear disc brakes.  143K low miles.  The 22re engine, the best Toyota engine ever, runs great.  The 5-speed manual transmission shifts as it should.  These cars are a blast to drive with the top down and reliable like a Toyota pick-up truck but with a convertible body.  This was my daily driver to work locally for years, but the car is now mostly sitting - life happens and it is time to find a new owner for this Japanese collector car.  I have already done much of the legwork in finding and purchasing most of the parts to finish this car -- over $500 of new/rebuilt/used parts + both Haynes and Chilton service manuals with the sale. With a little work, this will be a great car to cruise in for a long, long time.

GOOD:
Engine runs strong  (Recent oil change, new spark plugs, new air filter.  Valve cover gasket done 1000 miles ago)
Transmission shifts smooth with no popouts of any gear.
Clutch engages as it should
Rear Wheel Drive
Independent Rear Suspension with rear disc brakes
Flip up headlights work as they should
Cruise Control works
Aftermarket CD Player (will include an OEM stereo and replacement radio surround)
Front bucket seats with functional lumbar support adjustment in driver seat
Power windows all work
Nice sounding exhaust note with Dynamax muffler
New master cylinder and battery in last 1000 miles
Starter just replaced in early September with remanufactured Bosch unit.
Power steering works good
Brakes checked when master cylinder was replaced -- Brakes working good.
No holes in convertible top (see note below about rear window)

BAD:
Steering rack boots need replacing (I was going to replace the entire assembly.  Rebuilt Steering Rack & Pinion, mounting grommets, inner tie rods, outer tie rods, and both high & low pressure power steering hoses for the job included with sale)
Needs Wheel Alignment (needs to be done after Steering Rack replacement)
Power Convertible top a little slow or needs help moving.  (Suspect hydraulic fluid is low)
Rear convertible top window needs replacing due to fabric tear (Replacement window included)
Windshield needs replacing due to cracks (Available for $40 at Pick-n-Pull)
Some rust (All rusted areas have been treated with either POR-15 or Eastwood Rust Encapsulator.  Body work needs finishing)
Slow leak in one wheel (OE replacement wheel included in sale)
Cowl panel at base of windshield rusted (Replacement included in sale)
Crack in dash pad (typical for year)
Small tear in driver seat bolster
Air Conditioner not working (never needed it due to it being a convertible)
Needs radio antenna.
Has speedometer and odometer error (diagnosed as stretched speedometer cable - reads fast, so actual mileage on car is lower than what odometer reads.  New cable available for $39 thru Rock Auto)
Some of the electrical contacts/grounds in the car likely need some cleaning

Also including other miscellaneous parts, such as an extra pop-up headlight and fender flare gaskets.  Again, this is a running and driving project with almost all of the parts needed to finish included with the sale.  

$2200/firm.  Low ball offers will be ignored.    ", (richmond / seacliff),2016-09-13T23:45:51-0700

Hello, I have a 1996 Mazda MX-6 M-Edition 2 door coupe for sale. It has all the upgrades (V6, leather seats, sun roof, larger wheels, alarm system) and I've been the only owner. It's had regular maintenance and oil changes throughout and never had a problem with smog checks. Only 100K miles. Just renewed car registration, so you'll save some money there. The car is an automatic and it's burgundy in color.

Car runs well, but it has a fair amount of body damage and wear and tear. There's body damage on the driver side door, by the driver side headlight (headlight works fine but isn't fixed properly), and on the passenger side door. On the inside, there's some tears in the front 2 leather seats, though the back seat is in pretty good condition. I've attached a bunch of picture to give you a feel. 

Kelley Blue Book for this car in Fair Condition is $2100.    ", (noe valley),2016-10-03T22:47:11-0700

Hi, I'm moving across the country and won't need a car anymore, so I'm saying goodbye to my super reliable 2011 Honda Civic DX-VP 4-door sedan! I am the original owner of the vehicle and it has been routinely serviced every 5,000 miles. It has not been in any accidents and it is in great condition!

-- 2011 Honda Civic DX-VP 
-- 105,000 miles 
-- 4-door sedan with seating for 5
-- Grey 
-- Cloth seats
-- Great gas mileage (Miles per gallon: 25 city / 36 Hwy)
-- No power lock, but power windows
-- Tags good until April 2017
-- Tires and brakes are in very good condition
-- Automatic transmission, Front Wheel Drive
-- New stereo interface with CD player and USB, auxiliary, and Bluetooth (with mic for in-car phone calls) connectivity
-- Mostly freeway driving in Bay Area

Below is a list of minor cosmetic damages. I'm listing the car under the Kelley Blue Book value in order to sell it as is.
-- Deep scratch on hood about the size of a half dollar coin. I had it painted over in the original color to seal and protect it from rust 
-- Scratch on right side underneath door (See photo)
-- Front bumper has some surface scratches that can easily be buffed out. One of the sides is protruding a bit, but might be able to be popped back in. (See photo)
-- TPMS warning light is on. I took it to get diagnosed and the light sensor needs to be reset, but the tires are in very good condition.

Hello,

I have a 2008 Acura Tl-type S (blue) for sale. 

I am the second owner of the car. I maintain the car up to date with all the service that is needed. 
Everything in the car is stock and never tracked. 
Things to know about the car: Salvage title from previous owner. Nothing happen to the engine, previous owner had an accident and got hit on the passenger side door and the whole door had to be replace with a different VIN number, which made the car salvage. The car runs perfectly fine, had it for 5 years from 35,000 miles when I first bought it to 120k miles now. Never had one issue with the car.  

Service done to the car: Brand new Timing belt and spark plugs and major service that is needed to be done at 100k for the car all done. Have papers for all the service for maintenance I have done for the car. Over 3000 dollars worth of parts and maintenance done to the car to maintain in great running condition. 
new rotors and break pads change. The car will last for many years to come. 

Fully loaded sport package. Rear view camera, Navigation, etc. 

Con: Due to wear and tear of the many years of leather seats. Pictures below will show the condition of the interior seats. Rims are slightly curb. 

price: asking for $7000
contact: Emailing me is the best way. can set up a schedule to see the car if serious buyers. 

I took in consideration of all the maintenance I have done to keep this car in the best shape as I can before selling and will not accept Low ball price, so please don't waste my time. I am in no rush to sell. 

Serious buyers can come on the weekends anytime to come and schedule to see the car or weekdays before 2pm. 

I have pink slip in hand and ready to go. 
***if the post is still up then the car is still available. First come first serve. Thank you.

good strong running condition 350 V8. 144,xxx on the clock. escalade front clip from original owner, I bought it like this for the most part. daily driver but the constant and distant commuting is killin ya boy. 
engine and tranny are both strong, shifts smoothly. quick and fast truck. put new 20"" rims with good tires. new brake switch. new brake lights, head light and turn signal bulbs. replaced all interior lights. new air filter. wired for subs. Optima yellow top battery. aftermarket Sony deck w/aux. may include my old subwoofer setup just to make space in the house. power seats, power locks, power windows. all interior lights work. tints. 

receipts/docs will be included in a folder with truck info and whatnot. 

Cons:
To begin, the D/P door key was somehow lost, but the back door and ignition are the SAME key which I have 3 copies of. So therefore it's not a loss, just a weird way of getting in but works literally the same. 

Needs paint, primer is rough on left side but right side is smooth. unless you're down for the gritty street flat black look. mostly cosmetic stuff.

dashboard is cracked but I keep a cover over it so you'll never see it.

will add pictures later today 10/4

   ",32000,Stillen Suburban GTS,http://sfbay.craigslist.org//sfc/cto/5812336357.html,"
Frame Off Build One of a kind Stillen GTS Suburban. I bought this truck in late 2001 and the build took over 1 year to complete. Searching for a 1999 3/4 ton AWD low mileage Suburban to start with was no easy task. Once located I had it shipped to SoCal where I was living and then put it in the very capable hands of Auto Racing  Legend Steve Millen. We talked over a period of several weeks and his engineers worked with me on how I would utilize the truck my driving style and skills. When every bit of relevant data was finally crunched they went to work. The truck was disassembled and any part with the slightest wear was replaced with the OEM replacement. The entire truck was treated to a Double Dynomat treatment to help silence the Beast. Of course next came new carpet and headliner. The most striking modification was of course their amazing interior customization which consists of modified seats (all three rows) with premium ventilated leather and of course all of the hides were hand selected. When making custom seats of course it would be necessary to install Shiatsu massage on both front seats and heaters for front and rear for those chilly Hollywood Hills nights. After the seats were built they went to work on custom fabrication of a center console utilizing a base ordered from a 2001 Suburban. Of course 5 televisions with 2 DVD players would be mandatory with the front center doubling as the full time navigation screen. 1500 watts power the 12 speaker Dual Sub Woofer  Pioneer entertainment system. Dual air conditioning/heating is of course something I couldn't do without as well. For those very important starry nights Dual Electric Moon Roofs were installed. Time to go to work on suspension. The first thing was to lower the truck two inches via the frame and suspension because of driving style, Polyurethane mounts and bushings throughout with Bilstein Monotube gas pressures at all corners with a massive swaybar to keep things straight. Now the Engine, stock 290  horsepower was clearly not going to cut it so we started with a Whipple Supercharger with cold air intake. The stock injection was replaced with larger jets as well with a Hyperchip program to ensure all performance was being utilized. The breathing is managed by a JBA/Gibson Dual system. Stopping this beast is managed by AP Racing 6 Piston Calipers, with Weld wheels to roll on. I am sure there are many smaller details I have left out that went into the more than year long build, but when Stillen gets a truck they simply do it right. The Build cost me in excess of $90,000 excluding the cost of the truck which was a little over $28,000. I am not sure that it is even possible to get a Stillen GTS made anymore but the few that were made were made to last a lifetime.    ", (richmond / seacliff),2016-10-04T07:19:50-0700

I am selling my wife's 2007 BMW E65 Alpina b7. This is a real Alpina B7 that is completely original besides the tinted windows. The car is extremely rare, only 200 were imported into the US in 2007 and another 600 were imported in 2008. The original MSRP on this car was 125k.

Alpina is a company located in Germany, close to BMW, that works with BMW to make limited specialty cars. Alpina changes the engine to a supercharged 4.4 liter, forged internals, v8 that has 500 hp and 516 lb-ft. Alpina also upgrades/changes the suspension, brakes, wheels, bumpers, spoiler, suede headliner, alpina steering wheel and gauges. This car comes with every option possible that the 7 series comes with and also has night vision (yes that's right night vision, which is pretty cool) and has the rear entertainment package.

The car is in overall great shape inside and out. The car has always garaged. The car has never been tracked or abused. My wife got this car for the ""wow factor"", not for the power. My wife and I just had a baby girl and it's time for us to get a more economical car for the family.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You can call, text or email me.

Hello,

It's time to sell my beautiful Subaru.  It has treated me very well over the years and we've been on a few adventures.  With AWD  and only about 87,000 miles, it's still the ideal adventure machine.  Since I moved to San Francisco I just don't drive it much anymore.  Except for the occasional weekend drive, the car spends nearly all of it's time parked in a garage away from the elements.  And I just gave it a fresh wash and wax... take a look!

Make: Subaru
Model Impreza 2.5i Sport Wagon.  Automatic transmission.  AWD (All Wheel Drive).
Year: 2007
Mileage: 87,0xx
Condition: Very good
Aftermarket accessories: Tinted windows (all) and a top-of-the-line locking Yakima bicycle rack for 2 bikes.
Title & registration: Clean and in my name.
Owner: I am the original owner
I have most of the paperwork for the maintenance and oil changes performed over the years.  The car has never had a single mechanical issue.

Thanks for looking!

Private Sale, save on taxes!
Selling my black on black 2005 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG with black leather interior and white stitched designo package seats. The truck has been babied and has only 84k miles. Interior is in great shape no rips or tears. Comes fully loaded with designo sports package, navigation and back up sensors. Clean CA title, truck has been meticulously maintained throughout the years and spent its entire life in CA. It runs and looks like new. There is no body damage or rust anywhere on the vehicle, has one scratch otherwise like new. It is as clean as you will find the only thing that was repainted on the truck was the wheel cover after a stop and go tap. 

I have spent thousands upgrading this G55 to look like the new models. It has xenon projector headlights with hid bulbs, updated grill, Led tail lights and new 22"" rims with new tires. I have also redone the headliner and upgraded it with all new upholstery, no expense spared. This gwagon is turn key ready, comes detailed and is a real head turner.

In 2005 the G55 received a significant power boost with a 5.5L supercharged V8 that cranks out 469hp and 516 torque which is 30% more power than the 369hp 2003-2004 G55 or 5.0L 292hp G500. This makes it one of the fastest and best sounding suvs available.

I have recently spent thousands on service and the truck will be taken to Mercedes for an inspection which will be provided to the buyer for peace of mind. No leaks or issues whatsoever. Please do not waste my time or send me low ball offers.

Prefer a straight sale but would be open to trades for a clean exotic or high end vehicle such as an Audi R8, Aston Martin Vantage, Bentley Continental, Lamborghini Gallardo or Porsche 911. If trading I must net more than my asking price, also willing to add cash for the right car. If serious please call or text.    ", (financial district),2016-10-04T08:54:00-0700

NO DEALERS, LOW-BALLERS, SCAMMERS, TIME WASTERS OR OTHER FLAKES! NO FLAKY OFFERS VIA EMAIL. IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MY CAR, THEN LETS MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO SEE. FIRST WHO SEES WILL BUY.

CASH ONLY. I HAVE TITLE IN HAND.

I am selling my much-loved well taken care of E350 which I have owned since 2012 as I have ordered a new car. Always dealer serviced, I have a complete history on the car to pass on to the new owner. No accidents, never smoked in, always garaged, the car looks like brand new. I had it detailed twice a year. Please see pictures. Buy with confidence. I drive the car daily and it drives like it did when I bought it. All freeway miles driving to SV from SF. 94,850 miles as of this ad. Just serviced at Mercedes of San Francisco at 93,300 miles. Replaced two front tires at 93,500. 

The car is fully equipped. Navigation, moonroof, dual power seats, AMG tuned suspension, leather seats, CD changer, sport package, premium package, power rear sub-blinds, 18"" sport wheels and a very rare beautiful color combination: Indium Gray with a Silk Beige interior with matching Ash wood trim. As said, all the books and records. Everything works.

I also have three transferable Safeguard extended warranties which the new owner can transfer for an additional cost by paying Safeguard directly (it's a nominal cost compared to their value). They are each valid through April 2017. One covers windshield, a second one covers dings and dents, and the third one covers wheels (very important in San Francisco!). Once transferred, the new owner can make an appointment with their local Mercedes dealer to have the covered items repaired. No deductible on any of these warranties! I bought them directly from Mercedes when I bought the car in 2012. Since 2012, I have probably had two windshields, several wheel resurfacings and dings pulled without paying an extra dime over what I originally paid for them when I bought the car.

Minor scratches and fading on exterior paint
Has the painted body colored cladding, not the gray plastic.
My family has owned it for the past 15 years and over 100,000 miles.

Smoke color bug shield. 
Factory shop manual. 
Speakers are Infinity reference in rear, JBL GTOs in front.
Sounds better than factory. Wired for a sub, but the sub was removed.
Alpine Deck head unit with Aux/USB input
and/or Factory CD/cassette w/ steering wheel controls.
As you can see, all the parts were replaced with the good stuff. Recent Oil Change
Heater/Fan Works, A/C is flaky. It needs recharging after about a month.
There must be a leak, but it was cheaper to just refill it 2-3 times
in the summer and ignore it the rest of the year.

This car has been reliable for 20,000 miles of commuting on the peninsula over the past year until last week. It started making a loud clunking noise from the front end; I took it by the shop and they determined that the front differential is binding up and I do not have time to get it fixed.  If someone has time for this repair it will make a great tahoe vehicle. It is very tough for me to sell this but I no longer need a Jeep for highway commuting.

You can't get a better snow/ski vehicle than this. This was a Colorado car most of its life and has easily made it through severe highway blizzards. 
It has done several of the 4x4 passes easily and rides like a luxury
car on the way home when you are done.

Asking 1250 OBO 
US cash dollars only! No trades, shipping, help selling or weird questions!
Please only reply to set up a time to see it.

- 6 Speed Manual Transmission, 3.6L Engine, 320HP (maybe a tad bit more with the K&N intake)
- Oil changed every 3K miles - maintained/serviced by Aldo at Aldo's Performance Motors in San Francisco
- Brand new Sumitomo HTR ZIII tires - less than 1k miles
- H&R Lowering Springs 
- Currently running straight pipes, with muffler delete. Sounds amazing, and there actually isn't any drone. Will include OEM muffler with Fister mod. 
- IMS has been done (picture included)
- K&N Performance Air Intake Kit (I also have an EVOMS Air Intake which I'll include)
- Aero Style front lip 
- Kenwood Excelon DNX9990HD Navigation/Entertainment system. Plays DVD/CD, Built in Garmin Navigation, 6.95"" Screen, Pandora, Bluetooth, iPod/iPhone connectivity, Sirius XM. 
- Will include a set of winter rims/tires. Sport Edition Cup 4 wheels + Dunlop Winter Sport 3D tires - You can see these on the picture with the roof racks. 
- Will include SeaSucker ski/snowboard racks. 

Interior is 9 out of 10. Exterior is 8 out of 10. Few rock ships in the front, which is expected with such a low car.  

If you are looking at this, you already know. This is an AWD Porsche. It has the Turbo Wide Body, Turbo Wheels, Turbo Brakes. The best looking 996 in my opinion. A classic now, and a future classic for sure. 

Asking $29,000 OBO. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via email. 

Thank you!    ", (haight ashbury),2016-10-01T21:21:22-0700

For sale is my 1990 BMW 3 Series (E30) convertible. I have owned the car for a little under a year (purchased in October 2015) and have put about 6,000 miles on it. The car has a clean title and to my knowledge has never been in a wreck.

The reason I'm selling the car is because I'm going to Europe to travel and would like the extra cash. I also drive a lot of cars for work and am sick of only driving the BMW when it comes time to move parking spots to avoid street sweeping tickets.

The Good:

-All stock, never modified or messed with.

-Never broken down or refused to start in my year of ownership.

-Five new tires purchased less than a year ago.

-Convertible top can't be more than five years old (there's a receipt for it from the previous owner).

-New plastic rear windshield.

-No check engine light on

-Timing belt was done recently (maybe a year or two back).

-Tags are current.

-I'll smog it.


The Bad:

-Some rust spots on the paint (see photo).

-Rear window piping came off during the installation of the new windshield (see photo).

-Rear seats are ripped (see photo).

-Passenger side mirror is cracked (see photo).

-Rear passenger side wheel is slightly bent (see photo).

-When turning right you hear a grinding noise. Light Internet research says it could be anything from a bearing to low power steering fluid.

-""Brake Lining"" light is on as one of the brake pad sensors is broken.

Feel free to shoot me a call or text for more info about the car or to schedule a time to see it. My name is Michael. Feel free to shoot me a call, text or email. The car is located in the Excelsior district of San Francisco.    ", (excelsior / outer mission),2016-10-04T09:59:20-0700

Sporty handling, speed, and sheer good looks shouldn't be reserved merely for those with money to burn. The Nissan 370Z is your embodiment of those characteristics, at a more approachable price point. But fear not, you'll still stand out from the crowd in this smoldering 2010 coupe, thanks to its smooth lines, bi-xenon headlamps, and unique ""Black Cherry"" exterior hue. Whether it's your Monday morning trip to work or your Saturday afternoon joyride, the smooth-shifting six-speed manual transmission lets you fully engage with the road. And with a 332-horsepower 3.6L V6 engine and one heck of an exhaust note, you're in for a truly exhilarating ride behind the wheel of this 370Z.

• 6-Speed Manual Transmission

This was a weekend car only, a sporty coupe to take out every so often. I loved the throaty V6 and superior handling; it sounds like a Japanese muscle car. I'm selling it because I barely drive it, and rather than letting it just sit, I would prefer someone enjoy it.    ", (inner richmond),2016-09-07T18:06:34-0700

Selling my 1965 Ford F100 short bed truck. I bought the truck from a guy that got the truck from a man who bought it from a school district that he worked for up in North Fork, technically I am the fourth owner. I bought the truck with good intentions but unfortunately I don't have time for it right now. I do have the title in hand the truck does not have any penalties or late fees or leins, the truck is on a non operations with the DMV the title is clean and it will cost about $170 to register again. The truck body is straight and has minimal areas that need work, someone painted the truck and the paint job is starting to show its age other than that the body is in really good condition. The interior is in good shape the floor boards door jambs and rocker panels are in great shape some areas of very minor surface rust. The dash is all there and in tact with no rust or dents. The engine bay is in great shape no rust and is really clean it has a 240 cubic inch 6 cylinder motor with a 3 on the tree 3 speed transmission that runs very well. The truck is in really good shape and is all there and will need very little to get going again. I am asking $6,000 OBO 
DELIVERY OF THE TRUCK CAN BE ARRANGED FOR A FEE OF COURSE. 
I MAY ALSO BE OPEN TO TRADES.

Hi, you are looking at very nice and clean 2011 BMW 535i xDrive (all wheel drive) with super low 45K original miles in very good working condition. 
It has: M-Style Sporty Wheels, M- Steering Wheel, Navigation System Back Up Camera, Memory Seat Position, Wood Trim, Parking Sensors, Tinted Windows, Air Conditioning, Dual Climate Control, Power Steering, Power Windows, Power Mirrors, Leather Steering Wheel, Power Drivers Seat, Power Passenger Seat, Tachometer, Telescoping Steering Wheel, Steering Wheel Radio Controls, Sunroof, Moonroof, Driver Airbag, Passenger Airbag, Side Airbags, ABS Brakes, Traction Control, Dynamic Stability, Rear Defogger, Fog Lights, Intermittent Wipers, AM/FM, CD Player, Full Leather Interior Surface, Adaptive headlights, Child Proof Door Locks, Cup Holders, Head-Protection System, Heated Mirrors, Roll Stability Control, Tire Pressure Monitor, Vanity Mirrors, Xenon/HID Headlights.
It comes with rebuilt/salvage title due to a previous, very small front-end accident that happened when it had 20,500 miles on it. It only had a hood, front bumper and headlights replaced. There was no frame, engine, or transmission damage at all! So we drove it for 25,000 miles since then without any problems or issues. We also just had oil/filter replaced and new brakes installed. This beautiful car needs nothing more then a new loving home :) Make sure to call me at

I am selling my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT. It is a Bright White Clearcoat with the Black Suede interior and has only 16,9xx miles. The vehicle is located in Tucson

I am the 2nd owner and the vehicle has been garaged in Arizona its entire life. It was originally delivered to Lake Havasu in September 2013 where it was rarely driven. I bought it in Feb '16 with 11,277 miles and it has been garaged in Tucson ever since.

Customer Preferred Package 29L:
Panoramic Sun Roof
SRT High Performance Harmon Kardon 19 Speaker Audio System
Trailer Tow Group IV with Cover
Single Disc CD Player
The only option it doesn't have are the DVD Head Rests

6.4L 392ci Hemi, 475hp, All Time All Wheel Drive, 8 Speed Automatic with 4 cylinder mode (15 city/22hwy), Auto, Sport, Track, Snow and Tow modes as well as Launch Control, 0 to 60 in under 4.5 seconds, Push Button Start, Paddle Shifters, Heated and Cooled Seats, Heated Rear Seats, Rear AC and USB plug ins, Heated Steering Wheel, Rain Sending Wipers, High Beam Sensing Windshield, Park Sense with Backup Camera, Adaptive Cruise Control, Forward Collision Warning with Accident Avoidance Braking, Remote Start, Blind Spot Monitoring, Aux Plug in, USB Plug in, SDCard, CD Player, SRT Performance Pages with Race Timers and Gauges, All Weather Floor and Rear Cargo area mats, I could go on and on...

Aftermarket modifications:

5 custom powdercoated Rennen wheels with Continental DWS06 tires(2,300 miles ago)
AEM dry air filter
Rear resonators have been replaced with straight pipes but I still have the stock resonators and tips
Grill rings and lower bumper rings were coated in black plastic. Easily removable if you like the chrome 

It has been to the dealer twice since I bought it for the shifter recall update  and some software updates. All PCM, Transmission and Stereo updates have been done. The drivetrain warranty is 5 years or 100k miles and transferable at no cost so its under warranty until September 2018. If you buy a 2015+ Jeep SRT, you only get the 5 year 60k mile warranty. 

Take a look on Craigslist and AutoTrader and you will find less than 10 privately owned Jeeps with less than 30k miles in the entire country. Its the only one with these wheels, let alone a full size 5th spare. 

I am asking $55,000 or best offer as I am trying to buy a Hellcat Charger. Don't miss out as this well sell fast!

10/1/16 - Best offer so far is $51,500    ",,2016-09-29T15:32:55-0700

I'm sad to let it go, but its time to sell my Jeep Wrangler 4dr Unlimited Sahara edition.  It's been an amazing car and have so many good memories in it.  One owner, garage kept, and dealer maintained, this SUV has kept me safe through many Tahoe storms and been incredibly reliable.  You can take off the panels to give a sunroof or completely open feel during the summer.  The interior is a grey color and the fabric is stain resistant.  It's been slightly blacked out to give a more stealth look but never got to swapping out the rims.  The tires are brand new snow tires and are quiet for long distance travel.  I'm throwing in all mats, snow chains, and rear carpet protector.  It has about 61k miles on it with all records of maintence.  This is a rear wheel drive (2wd) vehicle good for the city and gas mileage. Text or email to schedule a viewing.  Never had any issues with it and the frame, body, and paint is flawless.  Must sell ASAP!  KBB is 21K!    ",,2016-09-04T15:46:44-0700

Hi im selling my just smog 2008 BMW 528i with sports package with only 75,000 miles. It does have a salvage title but this is how I bought it 4 years ago and it has never given me any kind of problems. The only thing wrong is that is has a small dent on the hood from a rock hitting me on the freeway like shown in the picture and the passenger seat belt light comes on which we were told it is a sensor under the seat but doesn't effect the seat belt other than that it is a awesome car. This car has been very good to me but my family has grown and since I just purchase an SUV and nobody is driving it anymore i decided to just sell it. It has power windows,locks,sunroof, and power seats, AC & Heater work great, CD player and built in navigation 20 inch BMW rims. I have pink slip, current smog and bill of sale in hand. I'm asking $11,000, I will consider all reasonable offers. No low balling please i don't need the money. If interested message me or call me at

This was a bay area car so there is some minor rust starting to show around edge of trunk lid and rear window. Nothing crazy but its there. Trunk n floors are solid interior in great shape must see to appreciate but again consider its a 1972 but in decent shape all body panels are super straight I love this car.
