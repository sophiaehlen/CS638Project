I have nick-named my 2010 Saab 9-3 Ioreck. 

Iorek (pronounced ""yore-eck"") originally hails from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I flew out to the land of enchantment and drove Iorek home. I am the second owner. His first owner was a family of Saab enthusiasts and had named him Max. I renamed him Iorek, after the character of Iorek Byrnison in Philip Pullman's book the Golden Compass. If you've read the book or seen the movie, you may remember the scene where the armoured polar bear Iorek asks the main character Lyra, ""Do you wish to ride me?""

Oh how you will wish to ride Iorek, the car. He's a Saab 9-3 Aero with all-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission.  The combination of a 6-speed manual with XWD is rare for a Saab -- and indeed pretty rare in general. The engine is a 4-cylinder turbo and takes premium (""super"") gasoline only. (Mid-grade or regular grade doesn't have enough octane to quench Iorek's thirst for power.)

Inside, Iorek has black leather seats, satellite radio, and blue-tooth. There are power seats, power door locks, a moonroof, cruise control, and tinted windows. Oh, here's something neat. The side mirror on the passenger side -- there's a button you can press to angle the mirror just a bit down. It's perfect for parallel parking, so you can see the curb along the passenger side of the car.

Iorek is painted Glacier Silver -- a quirky aqua blue. 

Iorek particularly loves road trips and curvy roads. We've been to Route 66, Yosemite, Vegas, Crater Lake, Jedediah Smith Redwoods state park, Highway 9, and Mount Diablo. By far, Iorek's favorite road trip is going up the Mendocino coast to visit the Westport Whale -- the curvy coastal highways make the manual XWD engine purr. (Polar bears can purr, cannot they?)

Like any polar bear, Iorek is ready for the snow. He has Continental Extreme Contact DWS all season tires. And there's a Saab-specific roof rack, and the seats in the back have a little cubby hole where you can stick your skies through. The car is not equipped with chains.

Oh oh oh, I almost forgot. Saabs are delightfully quirky. Here are three quirky things you must know:

First, the ignition key goes in the center console, right by the emergency brake. 

Second, press the cup holder button (below the radio and above the temperature controls) to make it flip out.

Third, in order to shift into Reverse, you will need to ""lift up"" a latch circumscribing the gear shaft. (Basically, if you have your hand gripping the gear shift as normally with your right hand parallel to the ground, then you simply rotate your hand 90 degrees downward, and use your fingers to grab and lift up the latch that surrounds the shaft. While lifting, shift to the left and up, release the latch, and you are now in reverse. Practice this several times before your test drive. I can show you how to do this in person.)

It is now time for Iorek to move on to his next adventure. He deserves a loving home with new owners who will pamper Iorek and take him on plenty of road trips.

My Mini is a 6-speed manual transmission, S version.  It gets 28 City and 35 Highway miles.  A Full tank gets me about 350 miles until the low fuel light comes on. For long road trips, that number jumps to 450 miles.

The Mini is mechanically Solid.  All maintenance is recorded on the Mini.  The Mileage is all City Miles and a few trips to LA and Lake Tahoe.

Tires good, and ready for ROUTE 6-6. Car has cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, Sirus Radio heard on Harman/Kardon Sounds System, all power and with Sun Roof to boot.  The interior is clean and black.  

The Mini is reliable and resourceful for the City.   Parking for a Mini in the City is NOT a problem.

There is only one owner.    ",,,,Mini Cooper S 2011,9000,,,,2016-10-04T15:10:04-0700,http://sfbay.craigslist.org//sfc/cto/5813211411.html, (mission district),,,,
